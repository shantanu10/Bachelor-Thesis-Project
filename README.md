Hybridisation of K-Means clustering with bio-inspired algorithms for data clustering
<ul>
<li> We optimize the strategy for clustering the information or data with the assistance of bio-inspired algorithms, K-Means clustering and Fuzzy C-Means clustering.</li>
<li> K-Means clustering is one of the well known and straightforward technique for data clustering which utilizes mean of dataset to gather the information vector. The constraint of this technique is that clustering to initial cluster being caught in nearby minima or maxima. </li>
<li> Our approach to enhance the performance of above algorithm is to combine it with bio inspired algorithms to make it fast and overcome the limitations.</li>
<li> We integrated firefly algorithm to more advanced clustering algorithm which is Fuzzy C-Means clustering through which we are able to get more accurate and faster results. We have also compared our proposed algorithm with the other existing algorithms on several measures. It is observed that our proposed algorithm outperform against the existing.</li></ul>
